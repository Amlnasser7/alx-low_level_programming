0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.
I learned about arithmetic operators, relational operators, boolean operators, comments, declaring variables and loops in C language.
